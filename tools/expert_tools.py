"""
Tools for analysing Fantasy Premier League experts' teams.

This module defines a small suite of general‑purpose functions for working
with well‑known FPL managers ("experts").  It maintains a mapping of
expert names to their FPL entry (team) IDs and exposes functions to
summarise their squad selections, recent transfers and historical
performance.  The goal is to provide abstract, composable building
blocks that allow a language model to answer questions such as:

* Which players are currently owned by multiple experts?
* What transfers did FPL Harry make in the last few gameweeks?
* How has FPL Raptor performed historically and what chips have they used?

The functions in this module use only publicly available endpoints of
the official FPL API and therefore do not require authentication.
