"""MCP tools for summarising FPL‑related YouTube videos.

This module exposes a single tool, ``summarise_fpl_youtube``, that
accepts a YouTube URL and returns a structured summary tailored for
Fantasy Premier League (FPL) analysis.  The tool downloads the
auto‑generated transcript of the video, extracts mentions of FPL
players, and compiles a brief overview of the main talking points.

The output contains:

* ``summary`` – A concise overview of the entire video (around
  600 characters), constructed by selecting representative lines from
  across the transcript.  It prioritises sentences containing FPL
  keywords (players, captaincy, fixtures) to capture the main
  themes.
* ``players`` – A list of dictionaries, each with ``player_name``
  and ``reasoning`` fields.  Up to ten of the most frequently
  mentioned FPL players are returned.  For each player, the tool
  extracts transcript snippets discussing price, minutes, rotation,
  fixtures and similar FPL‑relevant topics, appending their price
  and position from the FPL dataset.
* ``main_points`` – A list of high‑level discussion topics (e.g.
  "Captaincy", "Fixtures Analysis", "Differentials").  Each entry
  contains a topic name and a short summary composed of transcript
  lines where that topic was mentioned.
* ``video_id`` – The YouTube video ID for reference.

This tool is useful for ingesting content from podcasts or video
previews and extracting actionable recommendations and insights
without manual listening.
